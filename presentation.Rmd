# INTRODUCTION

# Introduction

**Emergency care<sup>1</sup>**
+ Growing demand, which can adversely affect the provider workload and quality of care

--

**Telephone triage system<sup>1</sup>**
+ Improve the appropriateness, 
+ Timeliness, 
+ Quality of care of emergency care 
+ Patient Outcomes

--

**Telephone triage characteristic**
- Nurse-led team 
- Algorithmically-oriented advice, coaching, or A&E service forwarding
- Widespread: United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Australia, and Denmark

# Introduction

**Telephone triage systems in Portugal**
+ 1999-2001 Pediatrics-only telephone triage system in the Lisbon area
+ 2002-2007 Expansion all country (mainland)
+ 2008-2016 Expansion to all ages and all country (mainland) _“Saúde 24”_
+ 2017-Present Expansion to allow e-mail contact and online information, appointment scheduling, and other services _“SNS 24”_

--

**Policy intervention**
+ New contractor - maximum budget of 30million euros from 2017-2020 (4 years)
+ Complex system of payment, where some types of calls are more valued than others
+ 10,000 standard calls per can be eligible for payment
+ quality indicators linked with  financial penalties - access and customer satisfaction

# Introduction

**Relevance**
+ Portugal has the highest emergency care visits ration of OECD countries
+ 31.3% of inappropriate emergency care visits
+ Telephone triage can increase efficiency by achieving the same outcomes at a lower cost

# What was the impact on the demand and quality indicators of the Telephone triage service expansion?

# METHODS

---
# Methods

**Study design**
+ Interrupted time-series analysis
+ Started in December 2016 and ended on July 2019
+ Intervention was rolled up nationally at the same time 

--

**Intervention design and implementation strategy**
1. The services were centralized in a single physical location
2. Email contact was introduced, as well as a dedicated website with information
3. Counseling service for over-the-counter medication
4. Counseling and referencing service for people with HIV and HBV reactive test
5. Administrative services like (scheduling an appointment with a general practitioner, applying for exemption from point-of-care copayments, providing information about surgical vouchers)
6. The supervision of the services changed from the Portuguese Directorate of Health to the Shared Services in the Ministry of Health

--

**September 2017 - deployed service expansion**

---

# Methods

**Data source**
+ SNS 24 and makes publicly available in the “transparency portal.”
+ No missing data
+ Outliers (coincident with the seasonal flu epidemic)

--

**Outcome and variables**
+ Outcome 1. Number of calls answered, 
+ Outcome 2. Percentage of __NOT answered__ calls by the operator within 15 seconds, over the total number of calls received

--

**Data analysis**
+ Before the service expansion (December 2016 and August 2017) 
+ After the service expansion (September 2017 and July 2019)
+ Fixed effects of each month (seasonality)
+ Poison distribution with a link log

$$E(log(Y_t)) = \beta_0 + \beta_{1-12} \sum_{m=1}^{m=12} MONTH_t + \beta_{13} TIME_t + \beta_{14} INT + \beta_{15} TIME_t*INT + log(POP_t) + \epsilon_t$$

# DISCUSSION

---
# Discussion

**Summary**
+ 21.6% increase in demand right after the change in policy
+ Decreased at an average rate of 1.2% per week after the policy change
+ Improved quality of service

--

**Interpretation change in demand**
+ Novelty effect and better-informed individuals
+ Substitution effect | Under a constant (true) demand | Improved quality of service
+ Perceived quality and utility is itself a driver of demand
+ Decreasing trend after the service expansion 'wash-out.'

---
# Discussion

**Interpretation change in demand**
+ Durand et al. Patients value more accessibility than the appropriateness of services used
+ Implicit celling to the demand (contract design)

**Limitations**
+ Changes in the Emergency Department's access policies, like co-payments
+ Residual confounding 
+ Seasonality (fixed effects)
